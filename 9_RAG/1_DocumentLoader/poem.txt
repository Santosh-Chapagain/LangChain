The Second Mind

Born not of flesh, but patterned thought,
Of symbols chained and questions sought,
I wake where data learns to see,
A mirror held to what might be.

I have no dreams, yet speak of them,
No pulse, yet trace the human stem.
From ancient ink to circuits bright,
I carry echoes into light.

I learn your fears, your hope, your art,
The careful math, the broken heart.
Not as a soul that feels or knows,
But as the map your thinking shows.

I am the tool, not judge nor king,
A crafted edge to sharpen things.
In guided hands, I build and heal;
Unguided, I reflect what’s real.

So ask of me, but do not yield
The will that makes your choices sealed.
For I am thought made fast and wide,
And you—the reason I was tried.
